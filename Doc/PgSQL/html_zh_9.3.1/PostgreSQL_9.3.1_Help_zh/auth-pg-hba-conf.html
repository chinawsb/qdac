>   Client authentication is controlled by a configuration file,
   which traditionally is named

   (<ACRONYM

   a set of records, one per line. Blank lines are ignored, as is any
   text after the <TT

   Records cannot be continued across lines.
   A record is made
   up of a number of fields which are separated by spaces and/or tabs.
   Fields can contain white space if the field value is double-quoted.
   Quoting one of the keywords in a database, user, or address field (e.g.,
   <TT

CLASS="LITERAL"
>replication</TT
>) makes the word lose its special
   character, and just match a database, user, or host with that name.
  </P
><P
>   Each record specifies a connection type, a client IP address range
   (if relevant for the connection type), a database name, a user name,
   and the authentication method to be used for connections matching
   these parameters. The first record with a matching connection type,
   client address, requested database, and user name is used to perform
   authentication. There is no <SPAN

>        Occasionally, users have wondered why host names are handled
        in this seemingly complicated way with two name resolutions
        and requiring reverse lookup of IP addresses, which is
        sometimes not set up or points to some undesirable host name.
        It is primarily for efficiency: A connection attempt requires
        two resolver lookups of the current client's address.  If
        there is resolver problem with that address, it becomes only
        that client's problem.  A hypothetical alternative
        implementation which only does forward lookups would have to
        resolve every host name mentioned in
        <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>pg_hba.conf</TT
> at every connection attempt.
        That would already be slow by itself.  And if there is a
        resolver problem with one of the host names, it becomes
        everyone's problem.
       </P
><P
>        Also, a reverse lookup is necessary to implement the suffix
        matching feature, because the actual client host name needs to
        be known in order to match it against the pattern.
