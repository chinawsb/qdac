>    Conceptually, every expression of a collatable data type has a
    collation.  (The built-in collatable data types are
    <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>text</TT
>, <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>varchar</TT
>, and <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>char</TT
>.
    User-defined base types can also be marked collatable, and of course
    a domain over a collatable data type is collatable.)  If the
    expression is a column reference, the collation of the expression is the
    defined collation of the column.  If the expression is a constant, the
    collation is the default collation of the data type of the
    constant.  The collation of a more complex expression is derived
    from the collations of its inputs, as described below.
   </P
><P
>    The collation of an expression can be the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"default"</SPAN
>
    collation, which means the locale settings defined for the
    database.  It is also possible for an expression's collation to be
    indeterminate.  In such cases, ordering operations and other
    operations that need to know the collation will fail.
   </P
><P
>    When the database system has to perform an ordering or a character
    classification, it uses the collation of the input expression.  This
    happens, for example, with <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ORDER BY</TT
> clauses
    and function or operator calls such as <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>&lt;</TT
>.
    The collation to apply for an <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ORDER BY</TT
> clause
    is simply the collation of the sort key.  The collation to apply for a
    function or operator call is derived from the arguments, as described
    below.  In addition to comparison operators, collations are taken into
    account by functions that convert between lower and upper case
    letters, such as <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>lower</CODE
>, <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>upper</CODE
>, and
    <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>initcap</CODE
>; by pattern matching operators; and by
    <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>to_char</CODE
> and related functions.
   </P
><P
>    For a function or operator call, the collation that is derived by
    examining the argument collations is used at run time for performing
    the specified operation.  If the result of the function or operator
    call is of a collatable data type, the collation is also used at parse
    time as the defined collation of the function or operator expression,
    in case there is a surrounding expression that requires knowledge of
    its collation.
   </P
><P
>    The <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>collation derivation</I
> of an expression can be
    implicit or explicit.  This distinction affects how collations are
    combined when multiple different collations appear in an
    expression.  An explicit collation derivation occurs when a
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>COLLATE</TT
> clause is used; all other collation
    derivations are implicit.  When multiple collations need to be
    combined, for example in a function call, the following rules are
    used:

    <P
></P
></P><OL
TYPE="1"
><LI
><P
>       If any input expression has an explicit collation derivation, then
       all explicitly derived collations among the input expressions must be
       the same, otherwise an error is raised.  If any explicitly
       derived collation is present, that is the result of the
       collation combination.
      </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>       Otherwise, all input expressions must have the same implicit
       collation derivation or the default collation.  If any non-default
       collation is present, that is the result of the collation combination.
       Otherwise, the result is the default collation.
      </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>       If there are conflicting non-default implicit collations among the
       input expressions, then the combination is deemed to have indeterminate
       collation.  This is not an error condition unless the particular
       function being invoked requires knowledge of the collation it should
       apply.  If it does, an error will be raised at run-time.
      </P
></LI
></OL
><P>

    For example, consider this table definition:
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>CREATE TABLE test1 (
    a text COLLATE "de_DE",
    b text COLLATE "es_ES",
    ...
);</PRE
><P>

    Then in
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>SELECT a &lt; 'foo' FROM test1;</PRE
><P>
    the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>&lt;</TT
> comparison is performed according to
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>de_DE</TT
> rules, because the expression combines an
    implicitly derived collation with the default collation.  But in
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>SELECT a &lt; ('foo' COLLATE "fr_FR") FROM test1;</PRE
><P>
    the comparison is performed using <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>fr_FR</TT
> rules,
    because the explicit collation derivation overrides the implicit one.
    Furthermore, given
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>SELECT a &lt; b FROM test1;</PRE
><P>
    the parser cannot determine which collation to apply, since the
    <TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>a</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>b</TT
> columns have conflicting
    implicit collations.  Since the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>&lt;</TT
> operator
    does need to know which collation to use, this will result in an
    error.  The error can be resolved by attaching an explicit collation
    specifier to either input expression, thus:
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>SELECT a &lt; b COLLATE "de_DE" FROM test1;</PRE
><P>
    or equivalently
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>SELECT a COLLATE "de_DE" &lt; b FROM test1;</PRE
><P>
    On the other hand, the structurally similar case
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>SELECT a || b FROM test1;</PRE
><P>
    does not result in an error, because the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>||</TT
> operator
    does not care about collations: its result is the same regardless
    of the collation.
   </P
><P
>    The collation assigned to a function or operator's combined input
    expressions is also considered to apply to the function or operator's
    result, if the function or operator delivers a result of a collatable
    data type.  So, in
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>SELECT * FROM test1 ORDER BY a || 'foo';</PRE
><P>
    the ordering will be done according to <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>de_DE</TT
> rules.
    But this query:
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>SELECT * FROM test1 ORDER BY a || b;</PRE
><P>
    results in an error, because even though the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>||</TT
> operator
    doesn't need to know a collation, the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ORDER BY</TT
> clause does.
    As before, the conflict can be resolved with an explicit collation
    specifier:
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>SELECT * FROM test1 ORDER BY a || b COLLATE "fr_FR";</PRE
><P>

>    A collation is an SQL schema object that maps an SQL name to

CLASS="SYMBOL"

    the name would suggest, the main purpose of a collation is to set

    it is rarely necessary in practice to have an
    <TT
CLASS="SYMBOL"

    <TT

    The <TT

    populates the system catalog <TT

    collations based on all the locales it finds on the operating

    <TT

    Use of the stripped collation names is recommended, since it will
    make one less thing you need to change if you decide to change to
    another database encoding.  Note however that the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>default</TT

    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"

CLASS="LITERAL"

    Thus for example,
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>SELECT a COLLATE "C" &lt; b COLLATE "POSIX" FROM test1;</PRE
><P>
    will draw an error even though the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>C</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>POSIX</TT
>
    collations have identical behaviors.  Mixing stripped and non-stripped
    collation names is therefore not recommended.
