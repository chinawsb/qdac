><P
>     An event trigger fires whenever the event with which it is associated
     occurs in the database in which it is defined. Currently, the only
     supported events are
     <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ddl_command_start</TT
>,
     <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ddl_command_end</TT
>
     and <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>sql_drop</TT
>.
     Support for additional events may be added in future releases.
   </P
><P
>     The <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ddl_command_start</TT
> event occurs just before the
     execution of a <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>CREATE</TT
>, <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ALTER</TT
>, or <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>DROP</TT
>
     command.  No check whether the affected object exists or doesn't exist is
     performed before the event trigger fires.
     As an exception, however, this event does not occur for
     DDL commands targeting shared objects &mdash; databases, roles, and tablespaces
     &mdash; or for commands targeting event triggers themselves.  The event trigger
     mechanism does not support these object types.
     <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ddl_command_start</TT
> also occurs just before the execution of a
     <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>SELECT INTO</TT
> command, since this is equivalent to
     <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>CREATE TABLE AS</TT
>.
   </P
><P
>    The <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ddl_command_end</TT
> event occurs just after the execution of
    this same set of commands.
   </P
><P
>    The <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>sql_drop</TT
> event occurs just before the
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ddl_command_end</TT
> event trigger for any operation that drops
    database objects.  To list the objects that have been dropped, use the
    set-returning function <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>pg_event_trigger_dropped_objects()</TT
> from the
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>sql_drop</TT
> event trigger code (see
    <A
HREF="functions-event-triggers.html"
>Section 9.28</A
>). Note that
    the trigger is executed after the objects have been deleted from the
    system catalogs, so it's not possible to look them up anymore.
   </P
><P
>     Event triggers (like other functions) cannot be executed in an aborted
     transaction.  Thus, if a DDL command fails with an error, any associated
     <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ddl_command_end</TT
> triggers will not be executed.  Conversely,
     if a <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ddl_command_start</TT
> trigger fails with an error, no
     further event triggers will fire, and no attempt will be made to execute
     the command itself.  Similarly, if a <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ddl_command_end</TT
> trigger
     fails with an error, the effects of the DDL statement will be rolled
     back, just as they would be in any other case where the containing
     transaction aborts.
   </P
><P
>     For a complete list of commands supported by the event trigger mechanism,
     see <A
HREF="event-trigger-matrix.html"
>Section 37.2</A
>.
   </P
><P
>     Event triggers are created using the command <A
HREF="sql-createeventtrigger.html"
>CREATE EVENT TRIGGER</A
>.
     In order to create an event trigger, you must first create a function with
     the special return type <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>event_trigger</TT
>.  This function
     need not (and may not) return a value; the return type serves merely as
     a signal that the function is to be invoked as an event trigger.
   </P
><P
>     If more than one event trigger is defined for a particular event, they will
     fire in alphabetical order by trigger name.
   </P
><P
>     A trigger definition can also specify a <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WHEN</TT
>
     condition so that, for example, a <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ddl_command_start</TT
>
     trigger can be fired only for particular commands which the user wishes
     to intercept. A common use of such triggers is to restrict the range of
     DDL operations which users may perform.
