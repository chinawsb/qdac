    Parameters will only be substituted in places where a parameter or
    column reference is syntactically allowed.  As an extreme case, consider
    this example of poor programming style:
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>INSERT INTO foo (foo) VALUES (foo);</PRE
><P>
    The first occurrence of <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>foo</TT
> must syntactically be a table
    name, so it will not be substituted, even if the function has a variable
    named <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>foo</TT
>.  The second occurrence must be the name of a
    column of the table, so it will not be substituted either.  Only the
    third occurrence is a candidate to be a reference to the function's
    variable.

><P
>    Since the names of variables are syntactically no different from the names

    Let's change the previous example to
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>INSERT INTO dest (col) SELECT foo + bar FROM src;</PRE
><P>
    Here, <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>dest</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>src</TT
> must be table names, and
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>col</TT
> must be a column of <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>dest</TT
>, but <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>foo</TT
>
    and <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>bar</TT
> might reasonably be either variables of the function
    or columns of <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>src</TT
>.
   </P
><P
>    By default, <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>PL/pgSQL</SPAN
> will report an error if a name
    in a SQL statement could refer to either a variable or a table column.
    You can fix such a problem by renaming the variable or column,
    or by qualifying the ambiguous reference, or by telling
    <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>PL/pgSQL</SPAN
> which interpretation to prefer.
   </P
><P
>    The simplest solution is to rename the variable or column.
    A common coding rule is to use a
    different naming convention for <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>PL/pgSQL</SPAN
>
    variables than you use for column names.  For example,
    if you consistently name function variables
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>v_<TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>something</I
></TT
></TT
> while none of your
    column names start with <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>v_</TT
>, no conflicts will occur.
   </P
><P
>    Alternatively you can qualify ambiguous references to make them clear.
    In the above example, <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>src.foo</TT
> would be an unambiguous reference
    to the table column.  To create an unambiguous reference to a variable,
    declare it in a labeled block and use the block's label
    (see <A
HREF="plpgsql-structure.html"
>Section 40.2</A
>).  For example,
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>&lt;&lt;block&gt;&gt;
DECLARE
    foo int;
BEGIN
    foo := ...;
    INSERT INTO dest (col) SELECT block.foo + bar FROM src;</PRE
><P>
    Here <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>block.foo</TT
> means the variable even if there is a column
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>foo</TT
> in <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>src</TT
>.  Function parameters, as well as
    special variables such as <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>FOUND</TT
>, can be qualified by the
    function's name, because they are implicitly declared in an outer block
    labeled with the function's name.
   </P
><P
>    Sometimes it is impractical to fix all the ambiguous references in a
    large body of <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>PL/pgSQL</SPAN
> code.  In such cases you can
    specify that <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>PL/pgSQL</SPAN
> should resolve ambiguous references
    as the variable (which is compatible with <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>PL/pgSQL</SPAN
>'s
    behavior before <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> 9.0), or as the
    table column (which is compatible with some other systems such as
    <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>Oracle</SPAN
>).
   </P
><P
>    To change this behavior on a system-wide basis, set the configuration
    parameter <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>plpgsql.variable_conflict</TT
> to one of
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>error</TT
>, <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>use_variable</TT
>, or
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>use_column</TT
> (where <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>error</TT
> is the factory default).
    This parameter affects subsequent compilations
    of statements in <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>PL/pgSQL</SPAN
> functions, but not statements
    already compiled in the current session.
    Because changing this setting
    can cause unexpected changes in the behavior of <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>PL/pgSQL</SPAN
>
    functions, it can only be changed by a superuser.
   </P
><P
>    You can also set the behavior on a function-by-function basis, by
    inserting one of these special commands at the start of the function
    text:
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>#variable_conflict error
#variable_conflict use_variable
#variable_conflict use_column</PRE
><P>
    These commands affect only the function they are written in, and override
    the setting of <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>plpgsql.variable_conflict</TT
>.  An example is
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>CREATE FUNCTION stamp_user(id int, comment text) RETURNS void AS $$
    #variable_conflict use_variable
    DECLARE
        curtime timestamp := now();
    BEGIN
        UPDATE users SET last_modified = curtime, comment = comment
          WHERE users.id = id;
    END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;</PRE
><P>
    In the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>UPDATE</TT
> command, <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>curtime</TT
>, <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>comment</TT
>,
    and <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>id</TT
> will refer to the function's variable and parameters
    whether or not <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>users</TT
> has columns of those names.  Notice
    that we had to qualify the reference to <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>users.id</TT
> in the
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WHERE</TT
> clause to make it refer to the table column.
    But we did not have to qualify the reference to <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>comment</TT
>
    as a target in the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>UPDATE</TT
> list, because syntactically
    that must be a column of <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>users</TT
>.  We could write the same
    function without depending on the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>variable_conflict</TT
> setting
    in this way:
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>CREATE FUNCTION stamp_user(id int, comment text) RETURNS void AS $$
    &lt;&lt;fn&gt;&gt;
    DECLARE
        curtime timestamp := now();
    BEGIN
        UPDATE users SET last_modified = fn.curtime, comment = stamp_user.comment
          WHERE users.id = stamp_user.id;
    END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;</PRE

    because the main SQL engine allows query parameters only in these
    commands.  To use a non-constant name or value in other statement

    <CODE

    Subsequent visits to that expression or command
    reuse the prepared statement.  Thus, a function with conditional code
    paths that are seldom visited will never incur the overhead of
    analyzing those commands that are never executed within the current
    session.  A disadvantage is that errors
    in a specific expression or command cannot be detected until that
    part of the function is reached in execution.  (Trivial syntax
    errors will be detected during the initial parsing pass, but
    anything deeper will not be detected until execution.)
   </P
><P
>    <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>PL/pgSQL</SPAN

    furthermore attempt to cache the execution plan associated with any
    particular prepared statement.  If a cached plan is not used, then
    a fresh execution plan is generated on each visit to the statement,
    and the current parameter values (that is, <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>PL/pgSQL</SPAN

    variable values) can be used to optimize the selected plan.  If the
    statement has no parameters, or is executed many times, the SPI manager
    will consider creating a <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>generic</I
> plan that is not dependent
    on specific parameter values, and caching that for re-use.  Typically
    this will happen only if the execution plan is not very sensitive to
    the values of the <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>PL/pgSQL</SPAN
> variables referenced in it.
    If it is, generating a plan each time is a net win.  See <A

   </P

>     The mutable nature of record variables presents another problem in this
     connection.  When fields of a record variable are used in
     expressions or statements, the data types of the fields must not
     change from one call of the function to the next, since each
     expression will be analyzed using the data type that is present

     for each trigger function and table combination, not just for each
     function.  This alleviates some of the problems with varying
     data types; for instance, a trigger function will be able to work
     successfully with a column named <TT

     to have different types in different tables.
    </P
><P
>     Likewise, functions having polymorphic argument types have a separate

     failures.

>    Statement caching can sometimes have surprising effects on the
