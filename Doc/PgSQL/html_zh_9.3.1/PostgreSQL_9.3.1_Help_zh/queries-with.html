><P
>   The basic value of <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>SELECT</TT

CLASS="LITERAL"
>WITH</TT

   break down complicated queries into simpler parts.  An example is:

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>WITH regional_sales AS (
        SELECT region, SUM(amount) AS total_sales
        FROM orders
        GROUP BY region
     ), top_regions AS (
        SELECT region
        FROM regional_sales
        WHERE total_sales &gt; (SELECT SUM(total_sales)/10 FROM regional_sales)
     )
SELECT region,
       product,
       SUM(quantity) AS product_units,
       SUM(amount) AS product_sales
FROM orders
WHERE region IN (SELECT region FROM top_regions)
GROUP BY region, product;</PRE
><P>

   which displays per-product sales totals in only the top sales regions.
   The <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WITH</TT
> clause defines two auxiliary statements named
   <TT
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>regional_sales</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>top_regions</TT
>,
   where the output of <TT
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>regional_sales</TT
> is used in
   <TT
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>top_regions</TT
> and the output of <TT
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>top_regions</TT
>
   is used in the primary <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>SELECT</TT
> query.
   This example could have been written without <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WITH</TT
>,
   but we'd have needed two levels of nested sub-<TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>SELECT</TT
>s.  It's a bit
   easier to follow this way.
  </P

CLASS="LITERAL"
>RECURSIVE</TT

CLASS="LITERAL"
>WITH</TT
>
   from a mere syntactic convenience into a feature that accomplishes
   things not otherwise possible in standard SQL.  Using
   <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>RECURSIVE</TT
>, a <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WITH</TT
> query can refer to its own
   output.  A very simple example is this query to sum the integers from 1
   through 100:

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>WITH RECURSIVE t(n) AS (
    VALUES (1)
  UNION ALL
    SELECT n+1 FROM t WHERE n &lt; 100
)
SELECT sum(n) FROM t;</PRE

   The general form of a recursive <TT

>WITH</TT

   <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>non-recursive term</I

CLASS="LITERAL"
>UNION</TT

   <TT

>UNION ALL</TT

   <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>recursive term</I

   a reference to the query's own output.  Such a query is executed as

  </P
><P
>   Recursive queries are typically used to deal with hierarchical or
   tree-structured data.  A useful example is this query to find all the
   direct and indirect sub-parts of a product, given only a table that
   shows immediate inclusions:

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>WITH RECURSIVE included_parts(sub_part, part, quantity) AS (
    SELECT sub_part, part, quantity FROM parts WHERE part = 'our_product'
  UNION ALL
    SELECT p.sub_part, p.part, p.quantity
    FROM included_parts pr, parts p
    WHERE p.part = pr.sub_part
  )
SELECT sub_part, SUM(quantity) as total_quantity
FROM included_parts
GROUP BY sub_part</PRE
><P>
  </P
><P
>   When working with recursive queries it is important to be sure that
   the recursive part of the query will eventually return no tuples,
   or else the query will loop indefinitely.  Sometimes, using
   <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>UNION</TT
> instead of <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>UNION ALL</TT
> can accomplish this
   by discarding rows that duplicate previous output rows.  However, often a
   cycle does not involve output rows that are completely duplicate: it may be
   necessary to check just one or a few fields to see if the same point has
   been reached before.  The standard method for handling such situations is
   to compute an array of the already-visited values.  For example, consider
   the following query that searches a table <TT
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>graph</TT
> using a
   <TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>link</TT
> field:

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>WITH RECURSIVE search_graph(id, link, data, depth) AS (
        SELECT g.id, g.link, g.data, 1
        FROM graph g
      UNION ALL
        SELECT g.id, g.link, g.data, sg.depth + 1
        FROM graph g, search_graph sg
        WHERE g.id = sg.link
)
SELECT * FROM search_graph;</PRE
><P>

   This query will loop if the <TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>link</TT
> relationships contain
   cycles.  Because we require a <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"depth"</SPAN
> output, just changing
   <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>UNION ALL</TT
> to <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>UNION</TT
> would not eliminate the looping.
   Instead we need to recognize whether we have reached the same row again
   while following a particular path of links.  We add two columns
   <TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>path</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>cycle</TT
> to the loop-prone query:

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>WITH RECURSIVE search_graph(id, link, data, depth, path, cycle) AS (
        SELECT g.id, g.link, g.data, 1,
          ARRAY[g.id],
          false
        FROM graph g
      UNION ALL
        SELECT g.id, g.link, g.data, sg.depth + 1,
          path || g.id,
          g.id = ANY(path)
        FROM graph g, search_graph sg
        WHERE g.id = sg.link AND NOT cycle
)
SELECT * FROM search_graph;</PRE
><P>

   Aside from preventing cycles, the array value is often useful in its own
   right as representing the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"path"</SPAN
> taken to reach any particular row.
  </P
><P
>   In the general case where more than one field needs to be checked to
   recognize a cycle, use an array of rows.  For example, if we needed to
   compare fields <TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>f1</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>f2</TT
>:

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"

        SELECT g.id, g.link, g.data, 1,
          ARRAY[ROW(g.f1, g.f2)],
          false
        FROM graph g
      UNION ALL
        SELECT g.id, g.link, g.data, sg.depth + 1,
          path || ROW(g.f1, g.f2),
          ROW(g.f1, g.f2) = ANY(path)

>   A helpful trick for testing queries
   when you are not certain if they might loop is to place a <TT

   in the parent query.  For example, this query would loop forever without
   the <TT

</P><PRE

SELECT n FROM t LIMIT 100;</PRE
><P>

   This works because <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
>'s implementation
   evaluates only as many rows of a <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WITH</TT
> query as are actually
   fetched by the parent query.  Using this trick in production is not
   recommended, because other systems might work differently.  Also, it
   usually won't work if you make the outer query sort the recursive query's
   results or join them to some other table, because in such cases the
   outer query will usually try to fetch all of the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WITH</TT
> query's
   output anyway.
  </P
><P
>   A useful property of <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WITH</TT
> queries is that they are evaluated
   only once per execution of the parent query, even if they are referred to
   more than once by the parent query or sibling <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WITH</TT
> queries.
   Thus, expensive calculations that are needed in multiple places can be
   placed within a <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WITH</TT
> query to avoid redundant work.  Another
   possible application is to prevent unwanted multiple evaluations of
   functions with side-effects.
   However, the other side of this coin is that the optimizer is less able to
   push restrictions from the parent query down into a <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WITH</TT
> query
   than an ordinary sub-query.  The <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WITH</TT
> query will generally be
   evaluated as written, without suppression of rows that the parent query
   might discard afterwards.  (But, as mentioned above, evaluation might stop
   early if the reference(s) to the query demand only a limited number of
   rows.)

CLASS="COMMAND"

   In each case it effectively provides temporary table(s) that can

    <TT

    allows you to perform several different operations in the same query.
    An example is:

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>WITH moved_rows AS (
    DELETE FROM products
    WHERE
        "date" &gt;= '2010-10-01' AND

    RETURNING *
)
INSERT INTO products_log

    This query effectively moves rows from <TT

    <TT
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>products_log</TT

CLASS="COMMAND"
>DELETE</TT

    deletes the specified rows from <TT
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>products</TT

    contents by means of its <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>RETURNING</TT

    primary query reads that output and inserts it into
    <TT
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>products_log</TT

   </P
><P
>    A fine point of the above example is that the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WITH</TT

    attached to the <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>INSERT</TT

CLASS="COMMAND"
>SELECT</TT

    the <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>INSERT</TT

    statements are only allowed in <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WITH</TT
> clauses that are attached
    to the top-level statement.  However, normal <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WITH</TT

    rules apply, so it is possible to refer to the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WITH</TT
>
    statement's output from the sub-<TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>SELECT</TT
>.
   </P
><P
>    Data-modifying statements in <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WITH</TT

    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>RETURNING</TT

    It is the output of the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>RETURNING</TT
> clause, <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>not</I
></SPAN
> the
    target table of the data-modifying statement, that forms the temporary
    table that can be referred to by the rest of the query.  If a
    data-modifying statement in <TT

>WITH</TT
> lacks a <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>RETURNING</TT
>
    clause, then it forms no temporary table and cannot be referred to in
    the rest of the query.  Such a statement will be executed nonetheless.
    A not-particularly-useful example is:

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>WITH t AS (
    DELETE FROM foo
)
DELETE FROM bar;</PRE
><P>

    This example would remove all rows from tables <TT
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>foo</TT

    <TT
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>bar</TT

    would only include rows removed from <TT
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>bar</TT
>.
   </P
><P
>    Recursive self-references in data-modifying statements are not
    allowed.  In some cases it is possible to work around this limitation by
    referring to the output of a recursive <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"

    WHERE p.part = pr.sub_part
  )
DELETE FROM parts
  WHERE part IN (SELECT part FROM included_parts);</PRE
><P>

    This query would remove all direct and indirect subparts of a product.
   </P
><P
>    Data-modifying statements in <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WITH</TT

    and always to completion, independently of whether the primary query
    reads all (or indeed any) of their output.  Notice that this is different

>SELECT</TT

CLASS="LITERAL"
>WITH</TT

    previous section, execution of a <TT

    as the primary query demands its output.
   </P
><P
>    The sub-statements in <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WITH</TT

    each other and with the main query.  Therefore, when using data-modifying
    statements in <TT

    actually happen is unpredictable.  All the statements are executed with
    the same <I

>Chapter 13</A

    cannot <SPAN

    alleviates the effects of the unpredictability of the actual order of row
    updates, and means that <TT

    communicate changes between different <TT

SELECT * FROM products;</PRE

    the outer <TT

   </P
><P
>    Trying to update the same row twice in a single statement is not

    (and sometimes not possible) to reliably predict which one.  This also
    applies to deleting a row that was already updated in the same statement:
    only the update is performed.  Therefore you should generally avoid trying
    to modify a single row twice in a single statement.  In particular avoid
    writing <TT
