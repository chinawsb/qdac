  </P
><P
>   <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN

   first two digit groups of the version number, e.g., 8.4.
   <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> minor versions are represented by the
   third group of version digits, e.g., 8.4.2 is the second minor
   release of 8.4.  Minor releases never change the internal storage
   format and are always compatible with earlier and later minor
   releases of the same major version number, e.g., 8.4.2 is compatible
   with 8.4, 8.4.1 and 8.4.6.  To update between compatible versions,
   you simply replace the executables while the server is down and
   restart the server.  The data directory remains unchanged &mdash;
   minor upgrades are that simple.
  </P
><P
>   For <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>major</I
></SPAN
> releases of <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
>, the
   internal data storage format is subject to change, thus complicating
   upgrades.  The traditional method for moving data to a new major version
   is to dump and reload the database.  Other methods are available,
   as discussed below.
  </P
><P
>   New major versions also typically introduce some user-visible
   incompatibilities, so application programming changes might be required.
   All user-visible changes are listed in the release notes (<A
HREF="release.html"
>Appendix E</A
>);  pay particular attention to the section
   labeled "Migration".  If you are upgrading across several major
   versions, be sure to read the release notes for each intervening
   version.
  </P
><P
>   Cautious users will want to test their client applications on the new
   version before switching over fully; therefore, it's often a good idea to
   set up concurrent installations of old and new versions.  When
   testing a <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN

   following categories of possible changes:

      This does not affect the integrity of the backup, but the changed
      data would of course not be included. If necessary, edit the
      permissions in the file <TT

>pg_dumpall</SPAN

      command from <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> 9.3.1,
      since this version contains bug fixes and improvements over older
      versions.  While this advice might seem idiosyncratic since you
      haven't installed the new version yet, it is advisable to follow
      it if you plan to install the new version in parallel with the
      old version.  In that case you can complete the installation
      normally and transfer the data later.  This will also decrease
      the downtime.

      On systems that have <SPAN

      there is probably a start-up file that will accomplish the same thing. For

      directory.  It is a good idea to rename the directory, rather than
      delete it, in case you have trouble and need to revert to it.  Keep
      in mind the directory might consume significant disk space.  To rename
      the directory, use a command like this:
</P><PRE

    performed in minutes.
   </P
><P
>    It is also possible to use certain replication methods, such as
    <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>Slony</SPAN
>, to create a standby server with the updated version of
    <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
>.  This is possible because Slony supports
    replication between different major versions of
    <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
>.  The standby can be on the same computer or
    a different computer.  Once it has synced up with the master server
    (running the older version of <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
>), you can
    switch masters and make the standby the master and shut down the older
    database instance.  Such a switch-over results in only several seconds
    of downtime for an upgrade.
