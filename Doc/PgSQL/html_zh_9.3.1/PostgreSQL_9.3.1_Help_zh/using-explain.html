><P
>    The structure of a query plan is a tree of <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>plan nodes</I
>.
    Nodes at the bottom level of the tree are scan nodes: they return raw rows
    from a table.  There are different types of scan nodes for different
    table access methods: sequential scans, index scans, and bitmap index
    scans.  There are also non-table row sources, such as <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>VALUES</TT
>
    clauses and set-returning functions in <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>FROM</TT
>, which have their
    own scan node types.
    If the query requires joining, aggregation, sorting, or other
    operations on the raw rows, then there will be additional nodes
    above the scan nodes to perform these operations.  Again,
    there is usually more than one possible way to do these operations,
    so different node types can appear here too.  The output
    of <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>EXPLAIN</TT
> has one line for each node in the plan
    tree, showing the basic node type plus the cost estimates that the planner
    made for the execution of that plan node.  Additional lines might appear,
    indented from the node's summary line,
    to show additional properties of the node.
    The very first line (the summary line for the topmost
    node) has the estimated total execution cost for the plan; it is this
    number that the planner seeks to minimize.

    Traditional practice is to measure the costs in units of disk page

   </P
><P
>    It's important to understand that the cost of an upper-level node includes
    the cost of all its child nodes.  It's also important to realize that
    the cost only reflects things that the planner cares about.
    In particular, the cost does not consider the time spent transmitting
    result rows to the client, which could be an important
    factor in the real elapsed time; but the planner ignores it because
    it cannot change it by altering the plan.  (Every correct plan will
    output the same row set, we trust.)
   </P
><P
>    The <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>rows</TT
> value is a little tricky because it is
    not the number of rows processed or scanned by the
    plan node, but rather the number emitted by the node.  This is often
    less than the number scanned, as a result of filtering by any
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WHERE</TT
>-clause conditions that are being applied at the node.
    Ideally the top-level rows estimate will approximate the number of rows
    actually returned, updated, or deleted by the query.

-------------------------------------------------------------
 Seq Scan on tenk1  (cost=0.00..458.00 rows=10000 width=244)</PRE

   </P

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"

    you will find that <CODE
CLASS="CLASSNAME"

    pages and 10000 rows.  The estimated cost is computed as (disk pages read *
    <A

>seq_page_cost</A

    <A
HREF="runtime-config-query.html#GUC-CPU-TUPLE-COST"

    <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>seq_page_cost</TT

CLASS="VARNAME"
>cpu_tuple_cost</TT

    so the estimated cost is (358 * 1.0) + (10000 * 0.01) = 458.
   </P
><P
>    Now let's modify the query to add a <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WHERE</TT

</P><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM tenk1 WHERE unique1 &lt; 7000;

                         QUERY PLAN
------------------------------------------------------------
 Seq Scan on tenk1  (cost=0.00..483.00 rows=7001 width=244)
   Filter: (unique1 &lt; 7000)</PRE
><P>

    Notice that the <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>EXPLAIN</TT
> output shows the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WHERE</TT
>
    clause being applied as a <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"filter"</SPAN
> condition attached to the Seq
    Scan plan node.  This means that
    the plan node checks the condition for each row it scans, and outputs
    only the ones that pass the condition.
    The estimate of output rows has been reduced because of the
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WHERE</TT
> clause.
    However, the scan will still have to visit all 10000 rows, so the cost
    hasn't decreased; in fact it has gone up a bit (by 10000 * <A
HREF="runtime-config-query.html#GUC-CPU-OPERATOR-COST"
>cpu_operator_cost</A
>, to be exact) to reflect the extra CPU
    time spent checking the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WHERE</TT

   </P
><P
>    The actual number of rows this query would select is 7000, but the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>rows</TT

    estimate is only approximate.  If you try to duplicate this experiment,
    you will probably get a slightly different estimate; moreover, it can
    change after each <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ANALYZE</TT
> command, because the
    statistics produced by <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ANALYZE</TT
> are taken from a
    randomized sample of the table.
   </P
><P
>    Now, let's make the condition more restrictive:

</P><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM tenk1 WHERE unique1 &lt; 100;

                                  QUERY PLAN
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bitmap Heap Scan on tenk1  (cost=5.07..229.20 rows=101 width=244)
   Recheck Cond: (unique1 &lt; 100)
   -&gt;  Bitmap Index Scan on tenk1_unique1  (cost=0.00..5.04 rows=101 width=0)
         Index Cond: (unique1 &lt; 100)</PRE
><P>

    Here the planner has decided to use a two-step plan: the child plan
    node visits an index to find the locations of rows matching the index
    condition, and then the upper plan node actually fetches those rows
    from the table itself.  Fetching rows separately is much more
    expensive than reading them sequentially, but because not all the pages
    of the table have to be visited, this is still cheaper than a sequential
    scan.  (The reason for using two plan levels is that the upper plan
    node sorts the row locations identified by the index into physical order
    before reading them, to minimize the cost of separate fetches.
    The <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"bitmap"</SPAN
> mentioned in the node names is the mechanism that
    does the sorting.)
   </P
><P
>    Now let's add another condition to the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WHERE</TT
> clause:

</P><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM tenk1 WHERE unique1 &lt; 100 AND stringu1 = 'xxx';

                                  QUERY PLAN
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bitmap Heap Scan on tenk1  (cost=5.04..229.43 rows=1 width=244)
   Recheck Cond: (unique1 &lt; 100)
   Filter: (stringu1 = 'xxx'::name)
   -&gt;  Bitmap Index Scan on tenk1_unique1  (cost=0.00..5.04 rows=101 width=0)
         Index Cond: (unique1 &lt; 100)</PRE
><P>

    The added condition <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>stringu1 = 'xxx'</TT
> reduces the
    output row count estimate, but not the cost because we still have to visit
    the same set of rows.  Notice that the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>stringu1</TT
> clause
    cannot be applied as an index condition, since this index is only on
    the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>unique1</TT
> column.  Instead it is applied as a filter on
    the rows retrieved by the index.  Thus the cost has actually gone up
    slightly to reflect this extra checking.
   </P
><P
>    In some cases the planner will prefer a <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"simple"</SPAN
> index scan plan:

</P><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM tenk1 WHERE unique1 = 42;

                                 QUERY PLAN
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Index Scan using tenk1_unique1 on tenk1  (cost=0.29..8.30 rows=1 width=244)
   Index Cond: (unique1 = 42)</PRE
><P>

    In this type of plan the table rows are fetched in index order, which
    makes them even more expensive to read, but there are so few that the
    extra cost of sorting the row locations is not worth it.  You'll most
    often see this plan type for queries that fetch just a single row.  It's
    also often used for queries that have an <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ORDER BY</TT
> condition
    that matches the index order, because then no extra sorting step is needed
    to satisfy the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ORDER BY</TT
>.
   </P
><P
>    If there are separate indexes on several of the columns referenced
    in <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WHERE</TT
>, the planner might choose to use an AND or OR
    combination of the indexes:

</P><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM tenk1 WHERE unique1 &lt; 100 AND unique2 &gt; 9000;

                                     QUERY PLAN
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bitmap Heap Scan on tenk1  (cost=25.08..60.21 rows=10 width=244)
   Recheck Cond: ((unique1 &lt; 100) AND (unique2 &gt; 9000))
   -&gt;  BitmapAnd  (cost=25.08..25.08 rows=10 width=0)
         -&gt;  Bitmap Index Scan on tenk1_unique1  (cost=0.00..5.04 rows=101 width=0)
               Index Cond: (unique1 &lt; 100)
         -&gt;  Bitmap Index Scan on tenk1_unique2  (cost=0.00..19.78 rows=999 width=0)
               Index Cond: (unique2 &gt; 9000)</PRE
><P>

    But this requires visiting both indexes, so it's not necessarily a win
    compared to using just one index and treating the other condition as
    a filter.  If you vary the ranges involved you'll see the plan change
    accordingly.
   </P
><P
>    Here is an example showing the effects of <TT

         Filter: (unique1 &lt; 100)</PRE
><P>
   </P
><P
>    This is the same query as above, but we added a <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>LIMIT</TT

    not all the rows need be retrieved, and the planner changed its mind about
    what to do.  Notice that the total cost and row count of the Index Scan
    node are shown as if it were run to completion.  However, the Limit node
    is expected to stop after retrieving only a fifth of those rows, so its
    total cost is only a fifth as much, and that's the actual estimated cost
    of the query.  This plan is preferred over adding a Limit node to the
    previous plan because the Limit could not avoid paying the startup cost
    of the bitmap scan, so the total cost would be something over 25 units
    with that approach.

    The planner's cost estimates are not linear and so it might choose
    a different plan for a larger or smaller table.  An extreme example
    is that on a table that only occupies one disk page, you'll nearly
    always get a sequential scan plan whether indexes are available or not.
    The planner realizes that it's going to take one disk page read to
    process the table in any case, so there's no value in expending additional
    page reads to look at an index.  (We saw this happening in the

    the estimated cost and row count for the Index Scan node are shown as
    though it were run to completion.  But in reality the Limit node stopped
    requesting rows after it got two, so the actual row count is only 2 and
    the run time is less than the cost estimate would suggest.  This is not
    an estimation error, only a discrepancy in the way the estimates and true
    values are displayed.

>    Merge joins also have measurement artifacts that can confuse the unwary.
    A merge join will stop reading one input if it's exhausted the other input
    and the next key value in the one input is greater than the last key value
    of the other input; in such a case there can be no more matches and so no
    need to scan the rest of the first input.  This results in not reading all
    of one child, with results like those mentioned for <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"

    Also, if the outer (first) child contains rows with duplicate key values,
    the inner (second) child is backed up and rescanned for the portion of its
    rows matching that key value.  <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>EXPLAIN ANALYZE</TT
