      uses for such a structure, they don't seem compelling enough to
      justify the effort required to make sure it always works safely.

      (Nikhil Sontakke)
     </P

      system index before locking the index's catalog.  This could deadlock
      against processes trying to acquire exclusive locks in the other,
      more standard order.
