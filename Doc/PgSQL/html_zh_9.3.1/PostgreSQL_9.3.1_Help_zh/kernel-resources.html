CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> requires a few bytes of System V shared memory
    (typically 48 bytes, on 64-bit platforms) for each copy of the server.
    On most modern operating systems, this amount can easily be allocated.
    However, if you are running many copies of the server, or if other
    applications are also using System V shared memory, it may be necessary
    to increase <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>SHMMAX</TT
>, the maximum size in bytes of a shared
    memory segment, or <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>SHMALL</TT
>, the total amount of System V shared
    memory system-wide.  Note that <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>SHMALL</TT
> is measured in pages
    rather than bytes on many systems.
   </P
><P
>    Less likely to cause problems is the minimum size for shared
    memory segments (<TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>SHMMIN</TT
>), which should be at most
    approximately 32 bytes for <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> (it is
    usually just 1). The maximum number of segments system-wide
    (<TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>SHMMNI</TT
>) or per-process (<TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>SHMSEG</TT
>) are unlikely
    to cause a problem unless your system has them set to zero.
   </P
><P
>    <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> uses one semaphore per allowed connection
    (<A
HREF="runtime-config-connection.html#GUC-MAX-CONNECTIONS"
>max_connections</A
>) and allowed autovacuum worker
    process (<A
HREF="runtime-config-autovacuum.html#GUC-AUTOVACUUM-MAX-WORKERS"
>autovacuum_max_workers</A
>), in sets of 16.
    Each such set will
    also contain a 17th semaphore which contains a <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"magic
    number"</SPAN
>, to detect collision with semaphore sets used by
    other applications. The maximum number of semaphores in the system
    is set by <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>SEMMNS</TT
>, which consequently must be at least
    as high as <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>max_connections</TT
> plus
    <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>autovacuum_max_workers</TT
>, plus one extra for each 16
    allowed connections plus workers (see the formula in <A
HREF="kernel-resources.html#SYSVIPC-PARAMETERS"
>Table 17-1</A
>).  The parameter <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>SEMMNI</TT
>
    determines the limit on the number of semaphore sets that can
    exist on the system at one time.  Hence this parameter must be at
    least <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ceil((max_connections + autovacuum_max_workers + 4) / 16)</TT
>.
    Lowering the number
    of allowed connections is a temporary workaround for failures,
    which are usually confusingly worded <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"

    left on device"</SPAN
>, from the function <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"

   </P
><P

    <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>SEMMAP</TT
> to be at least on the order of
    <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>SEMMNS</TT
>. This parameter defines the size of the semaphore
    resource map, in which each contiguous block of available semaphores
    needs an entry. When a semaphore set is freed it is either added to
    an existing entry that is adjacent to the freed block or it is
    registered under a new map entry. If the map is full, the freed
    semaphores get lost (until reboot). Fragmentation of the semaphore
    space could over time lead to fewer available semaphores than there
    should be.
   </P
><P

CLASS="VARNAME"

    That will cause postmaster child processes to run with the normal
