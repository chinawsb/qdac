      wouldn't get returned directly to the user, portions of it could be
      exposed in error messages if the data didn't parse as valid XML; and
      in any case the mere ability to check existence of a file might be
      useful to an attacker.  (CVE-2012-3489)

      The fix for CVE-2012-3489 broke that capability, and rather than
      expend effort on trying to fix it, we're just going to summarily
      remove it.

>      Prevent too-early recycling of btree index pages (Noah Misch)
     </P
><P
>      When we allowed read-only transactions to skip assigning XIDs, we
      introduced the possibility that a deleted btree page could be
      recycled while a read-only transaction was still in flight to it.
      This would result in incorrect index search results.  The probability
      of such an error occurring in the field seems very low because of the
      timing requirements, but nonetheless it should be fixed.
