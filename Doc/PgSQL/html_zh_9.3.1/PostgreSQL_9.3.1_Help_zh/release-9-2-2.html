     </P

CLASS="COMMAND"
>DROP INDEX CONCURRENTLY</TT
>
      allowed incorrect indexing decisions to be made during the initial
      phase of <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY</TT
>; so that indexes built
      by that command could be corrupt.  It is recommended that indexes
      built in 9.2.X with <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY</TT
> be rebuilt
      after applying this update.
     </P
><P
>      In addition, fix <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>CREATE/DROP INDEX CONCURRENTLY</TT
> to use
      in-place updates when changing the state of an index's
      <TT
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>pg_index</TT

      cause concurrent sessions to miss updating the target index, thus
      again resulting in corrupt concurrently-created indexes.

>      Also, fix various other operations to ensure that they ignore
      invalid indexes resulting from a failed <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>CREATE INDEX

      <TT

      on the table before corrective action can be taken to fix or remove
      the invalid index.

>      Revert patch for taking fewer snapshots (Tom Lane)
     </P
><P
>      The 9.2 change to reduce the number of snapshots taken during query
      execution led to some anomalous behaviors not seen in previous
      releases, because execution would proceed with a snapshot acquired
      before locking the tables used by the query.  Thus, for example,
      a query would not be guaranteed to see updates committed by a
      preceding transaction even if that transaction had exclusive lock.
      We'll probably revisit this in future releases, but meanwhile put it
      back the way it was before 9.2.
