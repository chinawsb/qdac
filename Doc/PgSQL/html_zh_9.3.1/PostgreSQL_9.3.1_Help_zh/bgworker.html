>  PostgreSQL can be extended to run user-supplied code in separate processes.
  Such processes are started, stopped and monitored by <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>postgres</TT
>,
  which permits them to have a lifetime closely linked to the server's status.
  These processes have the option to attach to <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
>'s
  shared memory area and to connect to databases internally; they can also run
  multiple transactions serially, just like a regular client-connected server
  process.  Also, by linking to <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>libpq</SPAN
> they can connect to the
  server and behave like a regular client application.

   worker processes because, being written in the <TT

   they have unrestricted access to data.  Administrators wishing to enable
   modules that include background worker process should exercise extreme
   caution.  Only carefully audited modules should be permitted to run

>   <TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"

   <TT

>BgWorkerStart_PostmasterStart</TT
> (start as soon as
   <TT

   requesting this are not eligible for database connections),
   <TT

   databases and run read-only queries), and
   <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>BgWorkerStart_RecoveryFinished</TT
> (start as soon as the system has
   entered normal read-write state).  Note the last two values are equivalent
   in a server that's not a hot standby.  Note that this setting only indicates
   when the processes are to be started; they do not stop when a different state
   is reached.
  </P

CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>bgw_restart_time</TT

   <TT

   case it crashes.  It can be any positive value,
   or <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"

  </P

>   <TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"

   the process is started.  This function must take a single argument of type
   <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>void *</TT
> and return <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>void</TT
>.
   <TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>bgw_main_arg</TT

   argument.  Note that the global variable <TT

>Once running, the process can connect to a database by calling
   <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>BackgroundWorkerInitializeConnection(<TT
CLASS="PARAMETER"
>char *dbname</TT
>, <TT
CLASS="PARAMETER"
>char *username</TT
>)</CODE
>.
   This allows the process to run transactions and queries using the
   <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>SPI</TT
> interface.  If <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>dbname</TT
> is NULL,
   the session is not connected to any particular database, but shared catalogs
   can be accessed.  If <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>username</TT
> is NULL, the process will run as
   the superuser created during <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>initdb</TT
>.
   BackgroundWorkerInitializeConnection can only be called once per background
   process, it is not possible to switch databases.
  </P
><P
>   Signals are initially blocked when control reaches the
   <TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>bgw_main</TT
> function, and must be unblocked by it; this is to
   allow the process to customize its signal handlers, if necessary.
   Signals can be unblocked in the new process by calling
   <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>BackgroundWorkerUnblockSignals</CODE
> and blocked by calling
   <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>BackgroundWorkerBlockSignals</CODE
>.
  </P
><P
>   Background workers are expected to be continuously running; if they exit
   cleanly, <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>postgres</TT
> will restart them immediately.  Consider doing
   interruptible sleep when they have nothing to do; this can be achieved by
   calling <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>WaitLatch()</CODE
>.  Make sure the
   <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WL_POSTMASTER_DEATH</TT
> flag is set when calling that function, and
   verify the return code for a prompt exit in the emergency case that
   <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>postgres</TT
> itself has terminated.
